# Biography of Tianbiao He

Dr. Tianbiao HE is a Research Professor and doctoral supervisor at Zhejiang University. He graduated from the Institute of Refrigeration and Cryogenic Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, in 2017, with a doctoral degree. From May 2017 to May 2018, he worked as a Research Fellow in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the National University of Singapore, collaborating with Professors Praveen Linga and I. A. Karimi on the research of LNG cold energy recovery and application of hydrate-based seawater desalination technology. From May 2018 to April 2023, he worked as an Associate Professor and Master's supervisor (outstanding young talent introduction) at China University of Petroleum (East China). Starting from May 2023, he has been working full-time at Zhejiang University.

His research focuses on the cascaded utilization of LNG cold energy, natural gas/hydrogen liquefaction technology, energy process system engineering (PSE), and applications of hydrate-based technologies (seawater desalination, CO2 capture). He has presided over and participated in more than ten projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation, Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, and enterprise collaborations. He has published over 50 academic papers in authoritative energy journals, with more than 1900 citations (Google Scholar) and an h-index of 23. He has applied for 11 invention patents, with 9 granted, and 8 of them have been transformed into technological achievements.

He has been invited to serve as the inaugural youth editorial board member for Frontiers in Energy (SCI), an editorial board member for Sustainability (SCI), a guest editor for Frontiers in Energy Research, and an editorial board member for Fluid Dynamics & Materials Processing (EI). In 2021 and 2022, he was consecutively listed as one of the top 2% global scientists in the rankings published by Stanford University.
