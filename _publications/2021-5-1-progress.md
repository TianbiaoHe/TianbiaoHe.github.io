excerpt: 'With the continuous growth of the population and the improvement of production, the shortage of freshwater has plagued many countries. The use of novel technologies such as desalination to produce fresh water on a large scale has become inevitable in the world. Hydrate-based desalination (HBD) technology has drawn an increasing amount of attention due to its mild operation condition and environmental friendliness. In this paper, literature on hydrate-based desalination is comprehensively analyzed and critically evaluated, focuses on experimental progress in different hydrate formers that have an impact on thermodynamics and dynamics in hydrate formation. Besides, various porous media promotion is investigated. Besides, the hydrate formation morphology and hydrate crystal structure with different hydrate formers are analyzed and compared. Moreover, molecular dynamic simulation is discussed to further understand microscopic information of hydrate formation. Furthermore, simulations of the HBD process by considering the energy consumption are also investigated. In conclusion, the hydrated based desalination is a potential technology to get fresh water in a sustainable way.'
