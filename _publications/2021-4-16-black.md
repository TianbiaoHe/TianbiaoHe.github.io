excerpt: 'Biomethane is regarded as a promising renewable energy source, with great
potential to satisfy the growth of energy demands and to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. Liquefaction is a suitable approach for long distances and overseas
transportation of biomethane; however, it is energy-intensive due to its cryogenic
working condition. The major challenge is to design a high-energy efficiency
liquefaction process with simple operation and configuration. A single mixed refrigerant
biomethane liquefaction process adopting the cryogenic liquid turbine for smallscale production has been proposed in this study to address this issue. The
optimal design corresponding to minimal energy consumption was obtained through
the black-hole-based optimization algorithm. The effect of the minimum internal
temperature approach (MITA) in the main cryogenic heat exchanger on the biomethane
liquefaction process performance was investigated. The study results indicated
that the specific energy consumption of modified case 2 with MITA of 2◦C was
0.3228 kWh/kg with 21.01% reduction compared to the published base case.
When the MITA decreased to 1◦C, the specific power of modified case 1 reduced
to 0.3162 kWh/kg, which was 24.96% lower than the base case. In terms of
exergy analysis, the total exergy destruction of the modified cases 1, 2, and 3
was 31.28%, 22.27%, and 17.51% lower than the base case, respectively. This
study’s findings suggested that introducing the cryogenic liquid turbine to the single
mixed refrigerant-based biomethane liquefaction process could reduce the specific
energy consumption and total exergy destruction significantly. Therefore, this study
could provide a viable path for designing and improving the small-scale biomethane
liquefaction process.'
